In Credit ratings, financial institutes will predict the credit rating of customers. In loan disbursement, banking institutes will predict whether the loan is safe or risky. In political science, classifying potential voters in two classes will vote or won’t vote. KNN algorithm used for both classification and regression problems.

In other words, the model structure determined from the dataset. This will be very helpful in practice where most of the real world datasets do not follow mathematical theoretical assumptions. Lazy algorithm means it does not need any training data points for model generation. All training data used in the testing phase. This makes training faster and testing phase slower and costlier. Costly testing phase means time and memory. In the worst case, KNN needs more time to scan all data points and scanning all data points will require more memory for storing training data."

        "Eager learners mean when given training points will construct a generalized model before performing prediction on given new points to classify. You can think of such learners as being ready, active and eager to classify unobserved data points.\n",
        "Lazy Learning means there is no need for learning or training of the model and all of the data points used at the time of prediction. Lazy learners wait until the last minute before classifying any data point. Lazy learner stores merely the training dataset and waits until classification needs to perform. Only when it sees the test tuple does it perform generalization to classify the tuple based on its similarity to the stored training tuples. Unlike eager learning methods, lazy learners do less work in the training phase and more work in the testing phase to make a classification. Lazy learners are also known as instance-based learners because lazy learners store the training points or instances, and all learning is based on instances.\n",

        "KNN performs better with a lower number of features than a large number of features. You can say that when the number of features increases than it requires more data. Increase in dimension also leads to the problem of overfitting. To avoid overfitting, the needed data will need to grow exponentially as you increase the number of dimensions. This problem of higher dimension is known as the Curse of Dimensionality.\n",
        "To deal with the problem of the curse of dimensionality, you need to perform principal component analysis before applying any machine learning algorithm, or you can also use feature selection approach. Research has shown that in large dimension Euclidean distance is not useful anymore. Therefore, you can prefer other measures such as cosine similarity, which get decidedly less affected by high dimension.\n",

        "## How do you decide the number of neighbors in KNN?\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, you understand the KNN algorithm working mechanism. At this point, the question arises that How to choose the optimal number of neighbors? And what are its effects on the classifier? The number of neighbors(K) in KNN is a hyperparameter that you need choose at the time of model building. You can think of K as a controlling variable for the prediction model.\n",
        "Research has shown that no optimal number of neighbors suits all kind of data sets. Each dataset has it's own requirements. In the case of a small number of neighbors, the noise will have a higher influence on the result, and a large number of neighbors make it computationally expensive. Research has also shown that a small amount of neighbors are most flexible fit which will have low bias but high variance and a large number of neighbors will have a smoother decision boundary which means lower variance but higher bias.\n",
        "Generally, Data scientists choose as an odd number if the number of classes is even. You can also check by generating the model on different values of k and check their performance. You can also try Elbow method here."

        "\n",
        "The training phase of K-nearest neighbor classification is much faster compared to other classification algorithms. There is no need to train a model for generalization, That is why KNN is known as the simple and instance-based learning algorithm. KNN can be useful in case of nonlinear data. It can be used with the regression problem. Output value for the object is computed by the average of k closest neighbors value.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Cons\n",
        "\n",
        "The testing phase of K-nearest neighbor classification is slower and costlier in terms of time and memory. It requires large memory for storing the entire training dataset for prediction. KNN requires scaling of data because KNN uses the Euclidean distance between two data points to find nearest neighbors. Euclidean distance is sensitive to magnitudes. The features with high magnitudes will weight more than features with low magnitudes. KNN also not suitable for large dimensional data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to improve KNN?\n",
        "\n",
        "For better results, normalizing data on the same scale is highly recommended. Generally, the normalization range considered between 0 and 1. KNN is not suitable for the large dimensional data. In such cases, dimension needs to reduce to improve the performance. Also, handling missing values will help us in improving results.\n",

Also, discussed its advantages, disadvantages, and performance improvement suggestions.\n",
