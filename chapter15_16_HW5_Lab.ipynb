    "## PART 1: Introduction to Linear Regression Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, linear regression is a popular approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the model is labeled multiple linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, the relationships are modeled using linear predictor functions whose unknown model parameters are estimated from the data. Such models are called linear models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression models are often fitted using the least squares approach, but they may also be fitted in other ways (see note at end). Additionally, the least squares approach can be used to fit models that are not linear models. Although the terms \"least squares\" and \"linear model\" are closely linked, they are not synonymous.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE:  Other modelings for linear regression include minimizing the \"lack of fit\" in some other form (as with least absolute deviations regression), or by minimizing a penalized version of the least squares loss function as in ridge regression ($L_2$-norm penalty) and lasso ($L_1$-norm penalty). This is a topic for advanced discussion!"
